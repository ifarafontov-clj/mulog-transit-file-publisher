# mulog-transit-publisher
Hello! Here is my take on rolling file publisher for and AWESOME mulog library (https://github.com/BrunoBonacci/mulog)
It uses cognitec Transit formatter (https://github.com/cognitect/transit-clj) to store log entites as Clojure data.
It supports log rotation based on maximum size or maximum age of a file.

## Installation

clj -e "(compile 'ifarafontov.NoopFlushOutputStream)"

Download from https://github.com/ifarafontov/transit-publisher.

## Usage

You can start the publisher using the following code:

```clojure
  (mu/start-publisher!
   {:type :custom
    :fqn-function "ifarafontov.transit-publisher/transit-rolling-file-publisher"
    :file-path "logz/log.json"
    :rotate-size {:mb 10}
    })

```
Accepted arguments:
| Key      |Default value |Description |
| ---------|--------------|------------|
| :file-path |"./app.log.json" |A path to logs directory, including file name. As there is no garanty in getting file's creation time on all filesystems (i.e. **ext4**) in Java - I decided to use file name for storing it. A **current** active log name will be formed as concatenation of: number of milliseconds from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z., an underscore character, and the file name (last element) from **:file-path** argument. Example: _1604991687740_log.json_ <br/> When the file will be rotated - it will be given a name consistiong of a file name from **file-path** element, a dot character, and a current **local** date presented as "YYYYMMdd_hhmmss" string. Example: _log.json.20201110_115350_ </br> |

Run the project directly:

    $ clojure -m ifarafontov.transit-publisher

Run the project's tests (they'll fail until you edit them):

    $ clojure -A:test:runner -M:runner

Build an uberjar:

    $ clojure -A:uberjar -M:uberjar

Run that uberjar:

    $ java -jar transit-publisher.jar
